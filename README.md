## Description

For this assignment I was tasked with creating a an API for a social network application where the user would be able to comment their thoughts and react to other uses thoughts. Using express.js and mongoose this application will be tested with insomnia to show that the posts are able to be made as well as the reactions. 

## Usage

The user will be able to comment their thoughts and then use reactions to reply to other users thoughts. The user will also be able to delete their thoughts and reactions allowing them to interact with the application.

## Installation

You will need to install node packages including express.js and mongoose.js after cloning the repo.
