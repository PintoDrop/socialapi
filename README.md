## Description

For this assignment I was tasked with creating a an API for a social network application where the user would be able to comment their thoughts and react to other users thoughts. Using express.js and mongoose this application will be tested with insomnia to show that the posts are able to be made as well as the reactions. Within insomnia I am able to create, update, find and delete a user and thought. I am also able to test adding and deleting a reaction to a thought, as well as adding or deleting a friend to a specific user. This is also synced to my mongoose so the data base is updated as I am making changes. I used an npm called moment to help with formatting the date of the thoughts and reactions.

## Usage

The user will be able to comment their thoughts and then use reactions to reply to other users thoughts. The user will also be able to delete their thoughts and reactions allowing them to interact with the application. If the user wishes to create an account they will be able to do so and then update it as needed.

## Installation

You will need to install node packages including express.js, moment and mongoose.js after cloning the repo.
